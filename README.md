# Keywords in C

This repository contains simple C programs that explain
what keywords are and how they behave in the C programming language.

The examples show both valid and invalid variable names
using keywords and keyword-like words.

## What are Keywords?
Keywords are reserved words in C that have predefined meaning.
They are used to define data types, control statements,
and program structure.

Examples of keywords:
int, auto, const, if, break, return, while

## Why We Use Keywords?
- To define variables and data types
- To control program flow
- To perform decision making and looping
- To give structure to C programs

## Importance of Keywords
- Keywords help the compiler understand instructions
- They make programs readable and meaningful
- They follow strict language rules

## Key Observation
- Keywords cannot be used as variable names
- Words similar to keywords are allowed

Example:
✔ automatic, condition, breakpoint  
❌ auto, if, break, int

## Purpose of This Repository
- To understand keywords clearly
- To observe compilation errors
- To learn valid variable naming rules
